        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <P>

            My name is Matthew Ontiveros Burt and I was born in Fort Collins CO. My hobbies and interests include
            playing music, traveling, playing poker, going to the gym, snowboarding, boating, reading, Star Wars, Marvel
            Comics, and ofcourse computer programming!
            I play few instruments but mostly play the piano these days though I have exeprience playing the violen and
            guitar. I attended
            Colorado State University for my undergrad where I studdied Liberal Arts. After school I worked in a variety
            of different fields
            and utlimatley ended up working in Aero-Space manufactruing then COVID-19 hit. It was during this time that
            I dived deeper into coding
            and it was in that time that my ambissions of becoming a developer spawned.
