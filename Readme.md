# Portfolio Web Page
* Portfolio Web Page is our 2nd assignment. It showcases some mock projects but also showcases my current understanding of HTML and CSS.

## CONTENTS OF PAGE SECTIONS:
* Background 
* The nav bar
* The image of "Me"
* The "About Me" section
* The "Work" section
* The "Conact Info" section

### Background
 * I changed the background color to "black."

### The construction of the nav bar

* To begin, I created a class called "nav-container." Inside this I put a header that displays my name "Matthew Onitveros Burt."  
* I created three links which I displayed on the right side of the nav bar.   The three links I created were the "About Me" section, the "Work" section, and the "Contact Info" section.
* Using CSS I added a background color of green.  
* I  added "groove" styling to the border and changed the font-famiy to "Impact."
* I made it so the links correspond to their respective sections.

### The construction of the image "ME" section
* I created a class called "ME."  I created a box and imported an image of myself.
* I used CSS to give the border "groove" styling and changed the background color to purple.

### The construction of the "About Me" section

* I started with creating a box.  Inside that box I gave it a title of "About Me."
* I filled the box with string that detailed some information for employers to get to know me.
* I used CSS to make the following changes:
    * The title's font-family to "Impact."
    * The content string font-family to "monospace."
    * The background color to a darker purple.
    * The boder-style to "groove."
    

### The Construction of the "Work" section
* I started by creating a box. Inside I gave it a title of "Work."  I then imported an four images to act as my mock-portfolio content.

* The four images imported I gave these project titles:
    * Cloudcare
    * VPNMaster
    * Mobile Magic
    * Reading Tree

* I gave all of the titles the font-family of "Impact."
* I turned all of the images into links that link to my only prior homework project deployed page.
* I gave all of the images a caption that described the projects.
* I used CSS to make all the caption font-family "monospace."
* I used CSS to change the border-style to "groove."
* I used CSS to change the background color to green.


### The Construction of the "Contact Info" section.

* I started by creating a box. Inside I gave it a title of "Contact Info." 
* I created two contact links:
    * www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-burt5

* I used CSS to change the font-family of the title to "Impact."
* I ueed CSS to change the font-family of the links to "monospace."
